    "# Sentiment Analysis for Soccer Games (EPL) using Twitter\n",
    "Author: Dixon Liang\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: This file is an empty demo for anyone's use, for the demo that corresponds with the video tutorial, please use the file \"12_5_20_ChelseaLeeds_Demo.ipynb\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Hi, welcome to my implementation of sentiment analysis of soccer games using Python, Tweepy, TextBlob, and BM25Okapi. This project was for the class CS 410 (Text Information Systems) at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign as part of my Masters in Computer Science curriculum. However, I would like to share it with anyone who might be interested in it. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Tweepy to source tweets from the Twitter API and TextBlob to provide a framework for natural language processing to provide sentiment analysis. In addition, we will use PyPi's implementation of BM25Okapi to provide context of the sentiment analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the result of this code will show the relative sentiment of a player's performance during a recent game. By using wisdom of the crowds, we hope to gain an idea of how the player performed. Using BM25Okapi, we will also be able to use relevant terms to see what might have caused sentiment to go way or another (ex. player scored a goal or provided an assist, etc.) Using PyPlot, we will also be able to visualize the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will provide a run through of how the code works with the main code in my Github, providing relevant output which may be useful for anyone interested. The source code is available at my Github (https://github.com/dixonliang). Technically, this code can be used for any soccer game, but given the popularity and language barrier, EPL games are likely to provide the most meaningful results. Adjustments could be made for La Liga or Serie A using Spanish or Italian NLP. Please feel free to reach out as I welcome any collaboration as the code can be improved and applied to different sports or different applications all together :) . \n"

    "# Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "This code gives a basic framework of senitment analysis for soccer games. Using Tweepy and TextBlob, we can get a basic idea of the player performance during the game of interest. BM25Okapi provides further context as to what may have contributed to these scores. For the most part, this code gives the user a basic idea of which players peformed well or poorly during a game in public opinion. Through extended use over a series of games or even a season, we can get a better idea of which players are in good or poor form. It would be a good tool to use in combination with game statistic analysis to determine player performance and player value. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "The code can be further improved in terms of cleaniness and efficiency. More features can be added to as well as implementation for deeper NLP for better classification of sentiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "There can also be other applications of this code. The most notable being adapted to other sports; all that would be needed to be done is an adjustment of some of the variables to make sense for a specific sport. The BM25Okapi algorithm terms can be adjusted for terms that are relevant in a positive or negative context for that specific sport. "
